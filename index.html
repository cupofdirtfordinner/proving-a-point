in fact, if i take this part of the post and type it out in notepad, and then name the file something.html, it will in fact show up as a (n albeit not very pretty) website.
<br> <br> <!--good on you for looking at the code! the <br> element is a linebreak. the element i'm typing in right now is a code comment, so it won't show up on the website and is only visible to people reading the code.-->
(protip: to host on github, make sure the html file is named "index.html" otherwise github won't know where to look and will give you a 404 error.)
